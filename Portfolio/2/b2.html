    <h2>Concept Sketches</h2>
    During the concept phase I tried my best to conceptualize unlock features for many sensors:

    <h3>Camera Unlocks</h3>
    My ideas for camera unlocks included striking a pose or using a physical keychain. The physical
    keychain would work similarly to face id, but could be given to a friend if they needed to borrow
    your phone. This idea intrigued me, but if the user left the key somewhere else they would have no 
    access to their phone.

    <h3>Motion and Accelerometer</h3>
    I explored motion and accelerometer unlocks next. Things like yoga routines and dance moves
    seemed tedious and too over the top for an unlock. The full arm rotation unlock would
    use the rotations diameter to confirm the users height, but would not work if the user
    had a growth spurt. 
    
    <h3>Compass Directions</h3>
    The point to location unlock also interested me, where the user would set a home location and
    the user would point the phone in the cardinal direction of that location, with the help of
    the gps. Issues would arrive if you were at the set location, or if the user was disoriented.
    
    <h3>Some Others</h3>
    I think my favorite idea was the heartbeat confirmation, where the users phone would measure
    the users heart rate, which would have to match the timing and bpm of a smart watch that the 
    user was wearing. I think this would have been very hard to implement, and the secondary device
    would add more constraint to the whole project.

    It was Emily that came up with a water logged idea, where the user would have to empty a screen
    of water to get into their phone.
