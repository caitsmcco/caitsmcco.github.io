    <h2>Description</h2>
    For this assignment we were tasked with creating a new way to unlock a phone using
    the available sensors. While my group had many ideas, we agreed that using the device's
    position would be easily replicable for a user. Emily came up with a water logged idea,
    where the screen was filled with water and the user had to pour out a certain amount 
    before it could be unlocked. This was the base idea of our project.

    <h3>Implementation</h3>
    This project was made with html, js, and css through Glitch. Glitch allowed us to collaborate
    in real time and test on our phones without having to push any code. As myself, Emily, and Carlene 
    all use iphones, the website requires an iphone for sensor permission grants and use.
