    <h3>Will the amount poured be clear to the user? What would be the acceptable range?</h3>

        We felt that the tilted water level would be hard for the user to accurately read,
        so we were quite sure adding a range of acceptable levels (between 45 and 55 rather 
        than only accepting 50) would be required. 
        We discussed adding a percentage to the water level to make the amount poured 
        very clear to the user, but I felt as if this would simplify the unlocking 
        sequence a lot and reduce the security. 

    <h3>Why water? If the phone is water logged, how would it make sense for the phone to unlock
    after pouring out 50%?</h3>

        For this we discussed the motivation of the user. Originally we had a drinking idea, but 
        the pouring motion felt more similar to 
        watering a plant, and thought that this could be a good way for the user to receive
        feedback on their login attempt.

        Some further ideas came from this:
        <br>-  The remaining water could be poured onto a plant, and if the plant thrived it 
            would unlock the phone. 
        <br>-  A plant would be displayed on screen and would grow as the user poured water on it.
            The height of the plant would be comparable to the background, and would unlock when 
            confirmed at the right height.
        <br>-  A plant would be displayed on screen and a hydration meter would fill to provide 
            feedback to the user.

        <br>We agreed that we were moving in the right direction, but felt that one pour - with no
        other conditions - did not feel secure. With our plant expansion we discussed having to
        water two plants, or water one specific plant. This is where the greenhouse idea came in.

    <h3>How would the user initialize the unlocking process?</h3>

        Initially, we planned to have a scooping motion to initialize the unlock - this would fill the phone 
        with water. Our directional change disrupted this idea as the phone displayed a plant, rather than 
        the water that would water the plant. Because of this, we decided that clicking a plant to water would
        initiallize the unlock, which would ensure that a tilted phone would not constantly being attempting to unlock.

    <h3> How would the user check get feedback?</h3>
        We felt that the user should get feedback when they returned their phone to a vertical position.
        A green key to unlock the greenhouse door was discussed, but we agreed the phone unlocking was 
        feedback enough that they succeeded - and would proide the authenticated user a quicker login process.

        As for failed login attempts, we made sure that failed attempts would be tracked. A dead plant on the 
        screen would indicate to the user that someone had attempted to get into their phone. These dead plants 
        could still be watered, but would give a visual represention of fails. Along with this, the user only 
        has three attempts to successfully unlock their phone. The failure counts are communicated
        to the user with the background, which grows colder and eventually snows in the user. In this 
        implementation the user is only "snowed in" for a few seconds, then the attempt counter is reset 
        and the user can reattempt their unlock.
