    <h2>Refinements</h2>
    After the concepts we knew we had to refine the button ideas. Some of my ideas were:
    <div class="row" style="margin-top: 20px;">
        <img src="assets/as1img/buttonalts.png" height="300px">
    </div>
    <span style="white-space: pre-line">
        - A thermometer that could be heated and cooled by the user while Kaylee was cooking. The temperature would equate to Kaylee's affection.
        <br> This idea didn't solve the third button problem, and didn't really make sense.
        <br> - A projector that would project the image on a screen. The user would slip a red or green piece of plastic over the image for hate or like.
        <br> This idea really leaned into Kaylees love for trivia and would have framed her as a host.
        <br> It would have required more buttons to go through all of the potential actions, and would have really reshaped the whole concept.
        <br> - Patting Jazzy (Kaylee's cat) to increase affection and pulling her tail to decrease it.
        <br> We didn't want to be mean to Jazzy...<br>
    </span>
    We decided that adding a balloon to inflate would move us in the direction we wanted. 
    <br>In this design the buttons were no longer just buttons, they interacted with each other in a whimsical way that added more user agency.
    <br>Kaylee put together our final refined sketch:
    <div class="row" style="margin:20px;">
        <img src="assets/as1img/refinedsketch.png" height="400px">
    </div>
    <p>
    For an added touch we decided to hand draw all of the assets, to allow Kaylees artistic personality to really have a spot light as well.
