    <h2>Description</h2>
    Tired of pesky snack stealers? Have a shared space where your treats 
    are not safe? Jack is here to protect you! This Arduino powered "snack in the box"
    will fend off thieves with an Arduino powered jump scare when the incorrect
    combination is received. What is the right combination? None other than 581! The numeric
    identifier for this lovely class. 

    <h2>Implementation</h2>
    Our Arduino used an IR sensor and remote, and two servos. The remote allowed us to
    give the user a multi-character input. The first servo operated as a latch to hold 
    the door in a locked position. If the Arduino received the correct input sequence this
    servo would rotate, allowing the door to pop open and reward the user with a snack. 
    After an interval of time, the servo would attempt to relatch the door. Ideally, I think 
    it would have been best to replace this timed mechanism with a light sensor, and I will 
    touch on this more later. The second servo would trigger when the Arduino received an
    incorrect input sequence, and triggered the abrupt launch of a scary joker to tell them off
    before slowly sculking back into it's hiding spot. There was a lot of iteration on this part
    of the project...
