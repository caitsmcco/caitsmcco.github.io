    After our refinements we created the "Green Thumb Unlock"!

    <br> This was a very interesting project. I think it has a lot of growth potential (pun intended). 
    It would have been nice to add more plant growth stages, and we could have experemented with the water meter more. 
    I feel that the sensor use was pretty limited, but it does feel intuitive. <br>
    If we had more time I think it would have been fun to explore 
    camera use. Later in development I thought it would be cool if we added a plant killer poster, that would 
    take a sneaky photo when a failed login attempt was made for the owner to see. <br> Our 
    greatest struggle was our team organization and scheduling, but overall I am really happy with
    how it turned out, and think we made what we had set out to make.
