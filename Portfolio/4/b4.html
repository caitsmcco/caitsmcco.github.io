    After our refinements we created the "Jack's Snacks"!

    <br> On the day of the demo we had issues with our wiring, but once everything was correct it worked as intended. 
    While operating it that day it became clear to me that adding a light sensor 
    to relock the box would have been ideal, the box usually latched itself before the door was actually closed, so we
    had to shift the door back into place after each demo.  We also had issues with the battery power source, the arduino 
    behaved differently when it was not connected to a computer. We were able to successfully hide all wiring 
    (excluding the laptop cord) but the components were half-hazardly secured inside, and required frequent adjustment.
    Given our time and knowledge we did solve the problem of stolen snacks, but the final prototype left much 
    to be desired.
