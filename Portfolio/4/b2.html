    <h2>Concept Sketches</h2>
    In our brainstorming phase, we had a lot of ideas. <br>
    Kaylee is a climber, an artist, a reptile enthusiast, and so much more... <br>
    Many of my ideas revolved around the ways that Kaylee acts, and had a focus on the user controlling Kaylee or having Kaylee react to the button presses.<br>

    I decided to clean up my favourite three to present to my group: 
    <br> - A pinball machine themed around Kaylee
    <br> - A love meter, where different items were tested against her
    <br> - A little game where she would scamper in the woods and bring you back something interesting with a fact about it.

    The Love Meter idea was pretty well received and had a lot of similar aspects to the other members ideas.<br>
    Kaylees love for trivia had the chance to really shine through with this approach - but we weren't sure on the direction yet.

    After trying to combine ideas and receiving critiques we came to the conclusion that our design wasn't very interactive, and technically had three buttons...<br>
    So we had a good start but had to go back to the drawing board for our button designs.
