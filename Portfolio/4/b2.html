    The prompt for this project was to solve an everyday problem.
    As a part of my brainstorming I took note of all of the tasks, forgotten chores,
    and inconviences as I went through my day.

    The first notable idea I had was a smart toothbrush holder. This tool would
    recognize when the user had picked up their toothbrush, and dispense toothpaste
    when it sensed the brush was in the correct location. After the toothpaste was 
    despensed, a timer would flip over to ensure the user brushed their teeth for 
    the correct amount of time.

    My second idea was a medication reminder, that later evolved into an pet insulin
    tracker. The general idea of this was a device that would play a sound to alert
    the user that they needed to take their pills, or give their diabetic dog an injection
    within a time window. It would recognize when the task was complete and turn on a light
    to assure the user that the task was done for that time period. If the medication was at
    a low quantity, the device would turn on another light to remind the user to get a refill.

    My final notable idea was a phone storage lock box, which would charge your device 
    and keep it out of reach to avoid unneccisary pick ups and screen time. This idea 
    was pretty basic and didn't inspire much.

    Jack and Hera had other ideas of reminders and other locked boxes. Jack's main problem 
    he had come up with was his roommates stealing his snacks. We all agreed that 
    this everyday problem could resonate with most people, and gave us room for expantion 
    if we wanted to add more complexity.

    When in class discussion we discovered that many other groups had locked box ideas, so we 
    knew we would have to add more to let our project stand out. We discussed having a 
    "snack timeout" period where the box would not open for any input, and all of our outputs 
    would be LEDs. This idea lacked creativity, so we kept brainstorming.

    The idea of a punishment for wrong inputs came up and we discussed having a mouse trap, 
    fly swatter, or a rotten food despensor, but Hera threw out the idea of a jack-in-the-box
    which inspired us the most.

    We initially planned to use a spring for our joker, and our first prototype used 
    pipecleaners to achieve this. 
    
    We did worry about the arduino's capacity to compress the spring,
    and thought using a stringed puppet with the help of gravity could achieve the same effect.
    I thought that a spinning component - like the fan - would have the capacity to reel in 
    the puppet, so this is the direction we headed.

    We split the workload at this point. Jack wrote the code for the IR sensor, Hera wrote the 
    initial structure of the code, and I got to work designing the box and puppet. 

    Our next meeting was close to the deadline and filled with doubts.
    The puppet was made but it was heavy, and the fan would hault completely when met with any resistance.
    We attempted a quick fix of switching the roles of our servo - which would have latched the door - and 
    the fan - which would have pulled the strings. This almost worked - but the end positioning of the fan was too
    inconsistant to successfully lock and unlock the door.
    With our limited knowledge of arduinos none of us were sure how we could add another motor, such as the stepper,
    and worried that even if we could add it in time, that it would also be unable to lift the puppet.
    We did more testing with the servo we had already implemented and decided our most achievable route would be 
    to add another servo, which we sourced through Jane. 

    We had a solution, but our list of problems expanded. We had trouble securing our components. I was mainly 
    using tape to secure everything together as I worried that hot glue would ruin the parts, but the servo would
    droop out of place due to the weight of the puppet and the servo's arms 
    regularly fell off. We swapped the puppet out for a cardboard cutout
    to reduce the weight, and ended up using hot glue for a more secure connection. This worked incredibly well
    and came apart at the end with no issue.
