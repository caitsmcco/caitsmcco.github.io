            I had a very advantageous plan for this project, and oh boy was it necessary to reduce the scope.
    
            In my initial plan, I wanted the device to keep track of <br>
            - multiple household members and their location in the home <br>
            - groceries, and all current items in the fridge for meal recommendations<br>
            - how many dirty dishes there were<br>
            - fully create an animate TWO friendly companions<br>
            - use multiple devices that would communicate<br>
        </div>

    <div class="row">
    The feedback I received from peers went along the lines of "you're insane, what do you mean you wanna do all that?!?!?"
    So I headed back to the drawing board. Initially, I really wanted to focus on the dishes. A device that would know how
    many dishes you had, reassure you that they really wouldn't take that long, and put on a nice timer and some music.
    This idea was still heavily centered around the idea of a friendly companion. This still would have required A LOT of 
    work, between creating a full character and somehow measuring dirty, clean and dry dishes and the users activity there simply
    was not enough time or resources to make it a reality. (but I was still hooked on little companions, I love little guys, it was my downfall)

    As time passed and I drove this thought train through my daily routine, I had an idea of a Tamagotchi rip off, where taking 
    care of your kitchen would take care of your friend. But, at this point I decided to scrap the animated companion idea completely...

    Rest in piece my little time wasters...<br>

    So then what? What was I really trying to do??
    
    Without the warm, comforting light of a friend, I turned to inspire the user through music - after all there is nothing better than 
    waking up to calm music. I am a massive fan of the Zelda soundtrack (and am praying that the Nintendo gods do not smite me for
    using it in this small, unpublished, project). I finalized my main, general design for the main screen, displayed in the center of
    the below image.

    I decided that I wanted to focus on meal encouragement, as conversations with friends revealed that I wasn't the only 
    person that wouldn't hold myself accountable for skipping meals, and it was time for me to create a solution...
