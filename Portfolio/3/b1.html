    <h2>Description</h2>
    Mornings can be tough. After rolling out of bed, snoozing the alarm and 
    walking over the kitchen, it can be easy to be intimidated by what to eat for breakfast.
    Some days, it might feel easier to skip it all together... NOT ANYMORE!<br>

    I am happy to introduce to you "Breakfast Now"! Throw your procrastination aside with this
    helpful tool that will ignite your fight or flight with the help of proximity technology.
    Your breakfast buddy will detect you <br>
    - walking past the kitchen<br>
    - procrastinating on your phone<br>
    - and leaving the kitchen without food!<br>
    It is more than happy to alert you when any of these events have occurred - so keep on track!
    When you aren't looking directly at the screen, or you are looking at the screen from a distance 
    "Breakfast Now" will act as a clock, with the date and time. When you approach, it can give you 
    quick and easy breakfast recommendation to destroy your choice paralysis! Better get cooking quick! (its watching)....
   
    <h2>Implementation</h2>
    This was created using HTML, JS, and CSS in Glitch. It was remixed off of 
    <a href=https://glitch.com/edit/#!/581-cube-proxemic?path=README.md%3A1%3A0>581 cube proxemic</a> 
    and <a href=https://glitch.com/edit/#!/581-basic-distance?path=README.md%3A1%3A0>581 basic distance path</a>.
    The implementation used fixed markers as proxemic input through the device camera. It is intended to be viewed 
    on a medium screen (laptop/tablet). 
    <h3>Proxemic Types</h3>
    <img src="assets/as3img/prox.png" width="100%">  

    The program uses identity as (using fixed id's) it can tell "food" (id 05) from a person (id 12). It uses orientation to detect if 
    the user has turned away from the device. The location of the device is also important, you would want to access
    this application specifically in a kitchen, where you can easily face the device while making food. Time is taken into 
    consideration when the device is identifying movements, as if the user walks away to quickly grab something, we do not
    want to trigger the alert state immediately.
