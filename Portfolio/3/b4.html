    At first, I wasn't sure if this was the project I wanted it to be. I had a lot
    of ambitions and had to thin out a lot of ideas. When I recorded this demo video,
    I came to realize this was exactly what I set out to make. The soothing music 
    brough me calmness, the flashing screen and aggressive music drew me back into the kitchen,
    and the success screen hit me with an unexpectedly large boost of dopamine. I enjoy the 
    simplicity of the whole project, 
    and feel that most of the reductions actually benefited the project. The initial sketches were 
    very busy and overwhelming to look at. <br>
    I do think I could have done a lot more, given more time and resources, but I am quite
    proud of what I have made for this project. I would for sure change the music to something in the public domain.
    If given more time I think I would have made it more of a smart fridge rather than a smart clock/meal planner. 
    Keeping track of every ingredient and linking it to a database of recipes is something I think could be acheived with AI
    data. I wanted to keep the on-screen instructions minimal, and disabled the ingredients and step-by-step as most breakfast 
    recipes are quite easy and interchangeable.
