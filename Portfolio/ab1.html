    <h2>Description</h2>
    Kaylee Nasser, lover of trivia, deserved to have a platform where she could share her interests and facts. This application allowed us to create that.
    <br>
    Kaylee's Love Guesser has two buttons.
    <h3>Swap Tool Button </h3>
    This is the "swap tools" button, which will equip a tool onto the users cursor:
    <div class="row" style="margin: 10px;"><img src="assets/as1img/tool-inflate.png" height="60px"></div>
    <div class="row">
        There are three available tools:
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <img src="assets/as1img/inflate.gif" height="60px"> When the user clicks the heart with the pump equipped, the heart will inflate - implying more love.
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <img src="assets/as1img/deflate.gif" height="40px"> When the user clicks the heart with the hand, the heart will have air squished out of it.
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <img src="assets/as1img/check.png" height="40px"> Lastly, when the heart is clicked with the check mark, Kaylee will judge the user's guess and provide her opinion.
    </div>
    Whether it's ceiling fans, snakes, nuts or wet socks, Kaylee always has something interesting to say.
    <h3>Heart Balloon Button</h3>
    The heart button will respond to whichever tool is selected, as described above. Once the user has checked their answer they will be equipped with a new tool:
    <div class="row">
        <img src="assets/as1img/next.png" height = "40px"> This tool allows the user to go to the next item when they press on the heart.
    </div>
