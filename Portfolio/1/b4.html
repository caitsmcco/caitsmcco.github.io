    Our final product is an application that really encapsulates all of who Kaylee is. The user gets the opportunity to get to know her in the same way we were able to.<br>
    Most importantly, it gave Kaylee the chance to yap about some of their favourite things. 
    <br>The following video is a demo of the final product.

    This project provided a lot of challenges for our group. Having to limit ourselves to only two buttons really constrained how we could achieve the result we wanted.
    <br>The whole group did a really good job brainstorming solutions, and the critiques helped a lot.
    <br>Kaylee did a great job making assets, providing all the data we needed, and did a great job styling the final product.
    <br> Abdullah added a lot of features to really engage the user. He did a wonderful job adding sounds and making the text catch the users eye.
    <br> I was mostly focused on creating assets and implementing the ability to equip tools to the users cursor.
    <br> We made a great team and were able to utilize our skillsets fully, helping each other along the way!
    <br> Along with all of the custom art, the background music was created by Kaylee's partner. It ensured that part of Kaylees heart was in all of it.
